# classifiers_live(An extension to PROJECT ATLANTIS)
correctly demonstrates the ability of deploying machine learning code remotely and making things to work(sensers reacting to the live model )
can be further extended for many applications

arduino code- provided in flappy.ino
python code for raspberry pi- will be uploading soon

both conected through usb (follows U-Art protocol)
use serial write on the arduino port to send data from pi to arduino conneted with pi
use serial read on arduino to interpret the data and then interact with various sensors.
